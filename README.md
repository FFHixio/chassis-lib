# NGN Chassis library

The NGN Chassis library is a JavaScript library for smart/lazy people. It
assumes a basic understanding of vanilla JavaScript and application structure,
and provides modular code libraries to simplify tedious UI tasks.

## Motivation (i.e. Use this if you agree with us)

We dont' like jQuery (anymore). It was an amazing feat of workflow engineering,
but it abstracts too much of the core language, resulting in unnecessary
over-engineering and often bloated applications. We believe the best technology
is the simplest, so we get back to the fundamentals. Unfortunately, some of
the fundamentals of UI development are still pretty tedious.

We jokingly describe this library as "jCorey" after the primary module author
((Corey Butler)[http://coreybutler.com]), because it was designed
according to Corey's annoyingly high expectations for "separation of concerns"
and improving the developer experience. This is coupled with
(Graham Butler)[http://grahambutler.com]'s (Chassis Lead) comparable
expectations in the same area, which we think everyone can benefit from :-)
