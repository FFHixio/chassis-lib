We'll do our best to fix problems in a timely manner, but remember this is software we voluntarily support

**If you want to expedite resolution**, one of the most effective ways to do so is to
[write a regression test](https://github.com/ngnjs/chassis-lib/wiki/Writing-a-Regression-Test).

By adding a regression test, you're recreating the issue, saving us alot of time.
