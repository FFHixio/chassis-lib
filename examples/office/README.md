# The Office

The office is open, and there are three employees currently clocked in. It's Jim's birthday today.

You can clock new employees in, and you can always clock out (Stanley wants to leave). You can also filter
employees by typing in any part of their name.

This little app uses an Employee NGN model, and an Employee NGN Store. Each field action taken on an employee will
trigger events, and you can watch the console to see what's happening.

1) Try editing Jim's last name to the correct one ('Halpert')
2) Try undo-ing that change! Click undo again to reapply.
3) Clock Jim's wife Pam in. (she was born 1 day after Jim)
4) Filter on "Halpert"
5) Clear the filter
6) Clock Stanley out!
